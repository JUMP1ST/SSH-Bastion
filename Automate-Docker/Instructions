How to Automatically Spin Up a New Ephemeral Bastion
To automate the process of creating a new bastion on-demand, you can use Docker:

Option 1: Automate with Docker and Systemd Socket Activation
This method spins up a Docker container-based bastion server only when requested by a user login attempt.

Create a Docker Systemd Service on the host:

# sudo vi /etc/systemd/system/docker-bastion.socket


docker-bastion.socket:
#ini
#[Socket]
#ListenStream=2222
#Accept=yes

#[Install]
#WantedBy=sockets.target

Create the Service to Launch the Bastion:

sudo vi /etc/systemd/system/docker-bastion@.service

docker-bastion@.service:
ini
[Unit]
#Description=Ephemeral SSH Bastion %I
#After=network.target

[Service]
#ExecStartPre=-/usr/bin/docker rm -f bastion-%I
#ExecStart=/usr/bin/docker run --rm --name bastion-%I -p %I:22 stateless-bastion
#ExecStop=/usr/bin/docker stop bastion-%I

[Install]
#WantedBy=multi-user.target


Enable and Start the Socket Service:

#sudo systemctl enable docker-bastion.socket
#sudo systemctl start docker-bastion.socket

With this setup, the bastion container will start automatically when a user tries to SSH on port 2222. It will terminate once the session ends, ensuring a fresh environment every time.

Unknown Consequences and Potential Challenges of Ephemeral Bastions
Session State Loss

If a user forgets to save their progress, all unsaved work is lost when the session ends.
Solutions: Educate users to store important files externally using tools like SCP.
Frequent Key Exchange

Every new container generates a new SSH host key, causing host key mismatch warnings for users.
Solutions: Implement known_hosts management scripts to update host keys dynamically or disable strict key checking.
Potential Downtime During Container Spin-up

It may take a few seconds for the new container to start when a user connects, causing a minor delay.
Solutions: Optimize the container image to ensure fast startup.
Limited In-Session Monitoring

Real-time session monitoring (e.g., logging shell commands) might be harder to implement with ephemeral instances.
Solutions: Forward all session logs to a centralized monitoring tool (like ELK or Graylog).
Compatibility Issues with Some Tools

Users may have trouble using certain tools that require long-lived sessions (e.g., RDP through SSH, port forwarding).
Solutions: Use time-based session limits or graceful disconnection warnings.
Increased Container Management Overhead

Managing frequent container creation and destruction may increase overhead on the underlying infrastructure.
Solutions: Use auto-scaling tools (e.g., Terraform or Kubernetes) to manage resources effectively.
