How to Automatically Spin Up a New Ephemeral Bastion
To automate the process of creating a new bastion on-demand, you can use tools such as Docker, Terraform, or Ansible. Below are two methods:

Option 1: Automate with Docker and Systemd Socket Activation
This method spins up a Docker container-based bastion server only when requested by a user login attempt.

Create a Docker Systemd Service on the host:
bash
Copy code
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/docker-bastion.socket
docker-bastion.socket:

ini
Copy code
[Socket]
ListenStream=2222
Accept=yes

[Install]
WantedBy=sockets.target
Create the Service to Launch the Bastion:
bash
Copy code
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/docker-bastion@.service
docker-bastion@.service:

ini
Copy code
[Unit]
Description=Ephemeral SSH Bastion %I
After=network.target

[Service]
ExecStartPre=-/usr/bin/docker rm -f bastion-%I
ExecStart=/usr/bin/docker run --rm --name bastion-%I -p %I:22 stateless-bastion
ExecStop=/usr/bin/docker stop bastion-%I

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
Enable and Start the Socket Service:
bash
Copy code
sudo systemctl enable docker-bastion.socket
sudo systemctl start docker-bastion.socket
With this setup, the bastion container will start automatically when a user tries to SSH on port 2222. It will terminate once the session ends, ensuring a fresh environment every time.

Option 2: Automate with Terraform
To integrate Terraform for automated bastion deployment, create a Terraform plan that spins up a Docker-based bastion on your infrastructure.

Terraform Example Plan:

hcl
Copy code
provider "docker" {}

resource "docker_container" "bastion" {
  image = "stateless-bastion:latest"
  name  = "ephemeral-bastion"
  ports {
    internal = 22
    external = 2222
  }

  restart = "on-failure"
}
Deploy the Bastion:

bash
Copy code
terraform init
terraform apply -auto-approve
Terraform ensures new containers are created as needed and handles state tracking, making this ideal for dynamic environments.

Advantages of Ephemeral Bastions
Reduced Attack Surface

Fresh environment for each session: Avoids lingering malware, compromised tools, or outdated software.
No long-term credentials or configurations: Prevents attackers from exploiting old SSH keys or passwords.
No Accumulated Cruft

Containers are destroyed after each session, preventing the buildup of old software, tools, or user scripts.
Easier to ensure software consistency across sessions.
Automatic User Accountability

By integrating with LDAP, every user logs in under their identity, eliminating shared accounts and making access traceable.
Simplified Maintenance

No need for manual patchingâ€”ephemeral instances always run the latest image.
Prevents Persistent Exploits

Since containers are short-lived, persistent exploits become nearly impossible to establish.
Resource Efficiency

The bastion only exists when needed, reducing resource consumption on idle infrastructure.
Unknown Consequences and Potential Challenges of Ephemeral Bastions
Session State Loss

If a user forgets to save their progress, all unsaved work is lost when the session ends.
Solutions: Educate users to store important files externally using tools like SCP.
Frequent Key Exchange

Every new container generates a new SSH host key, causing host key mismatch warnings for users.
Solutions: Implement known_hosts management scripts to update host keys dynamically or disable strict key checking.
Potential Downtime During Container Spin-up

It may take a few seconds for the new container to start when a user connects, causing a minor delay.
Solutions: Optimize the container image to ensure fast startup.
Limited In-Session Monitoring

Real-time session monitoring (e.g., logging shell commands) might be harder to implement with ephemeral instances.
Solutions: Forward all session logs to a centralized monitoring tool (like ELK or Graylog).
Compatibility Issues with Some Tools

Users may have trouble using certain tools that require long-lived sessions (e.g., RDP through SSH, port forwarding).
Solutions: Use time-based session limits or graceful disconnection warnings.
Increased Container Management Overhead

Managing frequent container creation and destruction may increase overhead on the underlying infrastructure.
Solutions: Use auto-scaling tools (e.g., Terraform or Kubernetes) to manage resources effectively.
Conclusion
Using ephemeral bastion servers with Docker containers offers a secure, accountable, and efficient solution, but also introduces new challenges that need to be carefully managed. This approach prevents the accumulation of unnecessary files, provides a clean environment for each session, and enforces user accountability through LDAP integration. By leveraging tools like Docker, systemd, or Terraform, you can ensure that your bastion is automatically deployed and destroyed, keeping your infrastructure clean and secure.
